# Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸

This project focuses on the classification of Iris flowers into three species: *Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*, using machine learning techniques. The project was developed as part of my internship at Cipherbyte Technologies.

## Overview

The Iris Flower Classification project uses the popular Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to classify these flowers into three different species based on their features.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, normalizing data, and preparing it for model training.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data to understand feature relationships and distributions.
- **Model Implementation:** Implementing and comparing various classification algorithms:
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model parameters to improve accuracy and efficiency.
- **Visualization:** Using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization and to illustrate model performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
  
## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience with supervised machine learning classification techniques and deepened my understanding of how to apply these techniques to real-world data. It was a rewarding part of my learning journey at Cipherbyte Technologies.
